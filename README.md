git clone https://github.com/WillamesCampos/flix-api.git
cd flix-api
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Django
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=DEV
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*

# PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_DB=flix_db
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# MongoDB
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root

```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### 4. Run with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start containers
make up-build

# Or start in background
make up-d

# Run migrations
make migrate
```

### 5. Or run locally

```bash
# Start only the database
make dev-db
make dev-mongo

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the server
make run-dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 📖 Usage

### Authentication

First, obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/authentication/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

Use the returned token in subsequent requests:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/movies/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here"
```

### Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture where each Django app is responsible for a specific domain:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each app has its own business logic
- **Base models**: Use of `BaseModel` for common fields (UUID, timestamps, auditing)
- **Services**: Complex business logic isolated in service classes
- **Permissions**: Centralized and reusable permission system

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Hub

The project is configured for automatic publishing to Docker Hub through GitHub Actions.

```bash
# Build image for production
make build-image TAG=v1.0.0

# Publish to Docker Hub
make push TAG=v1.0.0
```

### GitHub Actions

The project has configured workflows for:

- **Quality Assurance**: Runs lint and tests on Pull Requests
- **Docker Image Release**: Publishes Docker images when tags are created
- **Publish**: Complete validation and publishing pipeline

### Production Environment Variables

Make sure to configure the following variables in the production environment:

```env
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=strong-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com
# ... other variables
```

## 🎓 Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Migration from ID to UUID as Primary Key

**Challenge**: Migrate all models from `id` (BigAutoField) to `uuid` (UUIDField) as primary key, maintaining data integrity and relationships.

**Solution**:
- Creation of sequential migrations that remove the `id` field and add `uuid`
- Implementation of `BaseModel` with UUID as default PK
- Special migration for ManyToMany intermediate table (`movies_movie_actors`)
- Update of all tests and serializers to use `uuid` instead of `id`

**Lessons Learned**:
- In production, it would be necessary to create a manual mapping table
- Safer approach: create UUID as unique field first, then migrate gradually
- Always backup before complex structural migrations

### 2. ManyToMany Intermediate Table

**Challenge**: The intermediate table `movies_movie_actors` maintained `bigint` references while models used UUID.

**Solution**:
- Creation of migration that removes old constraints
- Table cleanup (in development)
- Recreation of columns with UUID type
- Recreation of all constraints and foreign keys

### 3. Custom Permission System

**Challenge**: Implement a granular permission system based on models and actions.

**Solution**:
- Creation of `GlobalDefaultPermission` that checks Django default permissions
- Integration with Django groups and permissions system
- Reuse in all views through `permission_classes`

### 4. High Coverage Testing

**Challenge**: Maintain test coverage above 75% with meaningful tests.

**Solution**:
- Use of `Factory Boy` to create test fixtures
- Creation of `BaseAPITest` for reusable API tests
- Unit tests for models, serializers, and services
- Integration tests for views and endpoints

### 5. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Challenge**: Configure complete CI/CD pipeline with tests, lint, and image publishing.

**Solution**:
- Separate workflows for QA and publishing
- Test execution in isolated environment with PostgreSQL
- Automatic Docker image publishing to Docker Hub
- Quality validation before publishing

### 6. Asynchronous Tasks with Celery and Redis

**Challenge**: Implement email notifications when reviews are created without blocking the API response.

**Solution**:
- **Celery** for asynchronous task execution
- **Redis** as message broker between Django and Celery workers
- **Django Signals** to automatically trigger tasks when reviews are created
- Separate Docker containers for web application and Celery worker

**Key Learnings**:

**Celery Configuration**:
- Celery must be initialized in `app/celery.py` and imported in `app/__init__.py` to ensure it loads with Django
- Use `@shared_task` decorator for tasks that can be reused across apps
- Configure Celery settings in Django settings with `CELERY_` prefix
- Use `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` pointing to Redis

**Redis as Message Broker**:
- Redis acts as a queue: Django puts tasks in, Celery workers take them out
- Fast and reliable for task queuing
- Use service name in Docker Compose (`redis://redis:6379/0`) instead of `localhost`

**Django Signals Integration**:
- Signals allow automatic actions when models are saved
- Use `@receiver(post_save, sender=Model)` to listen to model events
- Always wrap signal handlers in try-except to prevent errors from breaking the main request
- Register signals in `apps.py` with `ready()` method to ensure they load

**Docker Compose for Multiple Services**:
- Separate Dockerfiles for different services (web vs worker) optimize builds
- Use `depends_on` to ensure services start in order
- Share environment variables but configure service-specific ones
- Use entrypoint scripts to wait for dependencies (Postgres, Redis) before starting

**Best Practices**:
- Always pass serializable data to Celery tasks (UUIDs as strings, not objects)
- Use `task.delay()` for async execution, `task.apply_async()` for advanced options
- Log task execution and errors for debugging
- Test Celery locally with `--pool=solo` for debugging

### 7. Docker Compose Orchestration

**Challenge**: Coordinate multiple services (Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Celery) with proper dependencies and initialization order.

**Solution**:
- Use Docker Compose to define all services in one file
- Implement health checks for databases
- Create entrypoint scripts that wait for dependencies
- Use named volumes for data persistence

**Key Learnings**:

**Service Dependencies**:
- `depends_on` ensures services start in order, but doesn't wait for them to be ready
- Use entrypoint scripts with `nc` (netcat) to check if services are actually ready
- Health checks help Docker know when services are operational

**Environment Variables**:
- Use `.env` file for secrets (never commit it)
- Pass environment variables through `docker-compose.yml`
- Use service names for inter-service communication (`flix_db`, `redis`, not `localhost`)

**Entrypoint Scripts**:
- Entrypoint scripts run before the main command
- Use them to run migrations, wait for dependencies, or set up the environment
- Always use `exec` for the final command to ensure proper signal handling
- Copy entrypoint scripts AFTER `COPY . .` to preserve permissions

**Volume Management**:
- Named volumes persist data even if containers are removed
- Use volumes for databases to avoid data loss
- Different volumes for different services prevent conflicts

**Logging**:
- Suppress logs from infrastructure services (databases) using `logging: driver: "none"`
- Keep application logs visible for debugging
- Use `docker compose logs -f service_name` to follow specific service logs
